Review for:
1. **Brevity** - Can you cut 30%? Remove filler, redundancy
2. **AI tells** - Any "furthermore", "moreover", hedging language?
3. **Clarity** - Is every sentence < 20 words? Paragraphs < 5 lines?
4. **Voice** - Executive-level decisive tone? Active voice?
5. **Structure** - Scannable? Good headers? Lists not paragraphs?
6. **Duplication** - Each idea stated only once?
