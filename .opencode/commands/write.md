description: Start writing a new document with context gathering
---

You're beginning a new writing task.

First, ask the user these questions:
1. What type of document? (email, proposal, README, technical doc, meeting notes)
2. Who's the audience? (executives, engineers, external stakeholders, general)
3. What's the key message or goal?
4. Where should I save this? (file path)

Then:
- Create ONE document at that path
- Follow radical brevity principles (max 15 words/sentence, 3 lines/paragraph)
- Use executive voice (decisive, action-oriented, no hedging)
- Zero AI tells (no "furthermore", "moreover", "it's important to note")
- Iterate on the SAME file for all revisions

Remember: It's easier to add than remove. Start minimal.
